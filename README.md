Hi, I'm Chaturvyuha Kankipati, a B.Tech 3rd-year student with a passion for front-end development. I have experience in building responsive and user-friendly web applications using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SQLite. I'm currently learning Python to broaden my skill set and dive into back-end development. I enjoy creating clean and functional designs, and I use Figma to mock up my ideas before bringing them to life. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing badminton, listening to music, or planning my next travel adventure. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate on exciting projects!
